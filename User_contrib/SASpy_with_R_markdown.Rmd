# Introduction

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a
document markup language that is widely used to produce documentation
that can be easily edited, tracked through version control and
transformed into many different output formats.

One popular application of Markdown is [R
Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), as used by the
package `knitr` and that allows the inclusion and execution of R code
in markdown documents: it's a similar approach to Jupyter notebooks,
but based on Markdown documents and that implements [literate
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

It should be stressed that R Markdown documents are not limited to the
R language: the `knitr` library is in R and R is obviously a
first-class citizen, but it supports many different _engines_, one of
them being Python, and a single document can contain code in different
languages: as we will see we can use Python, R and SAS using SASpy.

# The challenge

SASpy output of non-tabular results is HTML, which makes sense
considering that all the target environments where it is used are
browser-based: Jupyter, Zeppelin and Databricks are the available
options at the time of writing. Markdown documents, however, do not
render HTML: the output of the code chunk should be in markdown, and
this is what then makes possible for tools like
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to convert to target formats.

This highlights a good use-case for using SASpy with markdown:
producing PDFs that can be highly customisable and include all the
tables and images (something currently not possible by exporting a
Jupyter notebook, for example).


# Making it work

To make SASpy work transparently in a `.Rmd` document we will take the
following approach:

* For _tables_ we can take advantage of the default format that SASpy
  uses, Pandas, that support markdown.
* For everything else, including plots, we will parse the HTML and
  convert it to markdown.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_condaenv("saspy_clean")

library(knitr)
hook_output = knit_hooks$get('output')
knit_hooks$set(output = function(x, options) {
  # this hook is used only when the linewidth option is not NULL
  if (!is.null(n <- options$linewidth)) {
    x = knitr:::split_lines(x)
    # any lines wider than n should be wrapped
    if (any(nchar(x) > n)) x = strwrap(x, width = n)
    x = paste(x, collapse = '\n')
  }
  hook_output(x, options)
})
```

We start by establishing the session, exactly like we would do in a
Jupyter notebook, with a twist: we activate [batch
mode](https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/advanced-topics.html?highlight=batch#using-batch-mode)
to have access to the HTML code, instead of the iPython object.

```{python, saspy-setup, warning=FALSE, echo="true", results="markup", linewidth=60}
import saspy
import pandas as pd
sas = saspy.SASsession(cfgname='mycfg', results='Pandas')
```

With batch mode activated we always get a dictionary with two keys,
`LOG` and `LST`, the latter containing the HTML code (or Pandas object
for tabular data).

```{python, saspy-batch, warning=FALSE, echo="true", results="markup", linewidth=50}
sas.set_batch(True)
```

For Pandas we can make use of the `to_markdown` method directly: the
utility function `p2m` simply wraps this to print the markdown table.

For HTML we get the body of the HTML (using BeautifulSoup), and
convert it to markdown through the `markdownify` library. The `h2m`
function encapsulates this logic.

```{python, saspy-utility, warning=FALSE, echo="true"}
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as BS
from markdownify import markdownify as md 

def p2m (p):
	print(p.to_markdown(tablefmt="github"))
	
def h2m (d):
	html = d['LST']
	soup = BS(html)
	body = soup.find('body')
	print(md(str(body)).strip())
```

With this functions defined the code is almost identical to what would
be the equivalent Jupyter notebook: only the last command changes
since we want to use the utility functions to output markdown.

The `columnInfo` method of SASpy will produce a markdown table (which
will then be correctly displayed in a PDF, through \LaTeX).

```{python, saspy-table, warning=FALSE, echo="true", results="asis"}
iris = sas.sasdata('iris','sashelp')
p2m(iris.columnInfo())
```

The same applies to plots, in this case a heatmap (which runs `proc
sgplot heatmap` in the backend):

```{python, saspy-heatmap, results="asis", echo="true", warning=FALSE, fig.pos="!H"}
h2m(iris.heatmap('PetalLength', 'PetalWidth'))
```

Submitting SAS code works the same way: here we use `proc sgplot
histogram` directly via sas.submit:

```{python, saspy-submit, results="asis", echo="true", warning=FALSE, fig.pos="!H"}
h2m(sas.submit("""
proc sgplot data=sashelp.iris ;
	histogram SepalLength;
run;
"""))
```

# From Rmd to PDF

R Markdown can be converted into standard markdown in several ways,
but `knitr` is the most common one and is integrated into [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), for example.

In the shell the following command can be used (depends on having R and `knitr` installed, of course):

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ R -e 'library(knitr); knit("SASpy_with_R_markdown.Rmd",
"SASpy_with_R_markdown.md")'
```

To produce the PDF there are again many different options, with
`pandoc` being one of the most common. There are quite a few options
to modify the output, namely the ability to specify a \LaTeX template
-- check pandoc's documentation for details.


```{bash, eval=FALSE, linewidth=50}
$ pandoc SASpy_with_R_markdown.md -o SASpy_with_R_markdown.pdf
```

# Other markup formats

The same approach describe in this document can be applied to other
formats, like [Asciidoc](https://asciidoc-py.github.io/) or
[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html), as long
as the utility functions are adapted to output the correct markup.
